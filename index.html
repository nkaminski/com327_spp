<p id="mcol">Hi, I'm Nash Kaminski a coterminal computer engineering student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. My main motivation to study enginering is the simple fact that I like to build cool things. More specifically, I have a particular interest in computer hardware design and robotics. Additionally, I tend to frequently be curious as to how things work or why things occur as they do. As a result of such, I also often dabble in the field of so called reverse engineering. I am also quite well known for my knowledge and proficiency with low level programming and working with Linux. Furthermore, I am a strong supporter of open source software and personally host a mirror of Arch Linux and have made contributions to a few open source projects.</p>
